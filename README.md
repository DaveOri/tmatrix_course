# tmatrix_course
notes, book, python notebooks and data

This is my first "lecture", first ipython notebook and first github repository. Please, be nice...

dsd.csv.gz files are drop size distribution data.

parameters.csv.gz are still data from the disdrometer like rain rate and other stuff. I don't know which parameters
are measured and which are computed

You'll find my lecture slides/notes (pytmatrix.pdf)

And in the subdirectory you'll find ipython notebooks
